# ðŸ“– Interview Questions & Answers

- What does SELECT * do?
It retrieves all columns from a table.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: SELECT * FROM Employee;

By using the WHERE clause.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE department = 'IT';

- What is LIKE '%value%'?
It is used for pattern matching in strings.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE name LIKE '%an%';

- What is BETWEEN used for?
